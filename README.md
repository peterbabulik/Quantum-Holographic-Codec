# Quantum-Holographic-Codec
A quantum simulation demonstrating holographic data compression and encryption using MERA tensor networks in PennyLane. This project maps 8 classical data points into a 3-qubit quantum state, transmitting information through a specific circuit geometry that acts as a symmetric private key.
